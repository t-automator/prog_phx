Notes and addenda from the Pragmatic Programmer book, Programming Phoenix >= 1.4

#### Purpose

This document is a personal log of my working through this book.  It's a great book but it seems as if there might need to be some updates and/or clarifications made for the examples to work with more recent versions of the software.  I'm not sure how long I'll keep track of stuff here, but hopefully it's useful for me (and maybe for you) somewhere down the line.
